1.Every night in my dreams
I see you I feel you
That is how I know you go on
Far across the distance
And spaces between us

Near, far, wherever you are
I believe that the heart does go on
Once more you open the door
And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on
You're here, there's nothing I fear
And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart and
My heart will go on and on

And you're here in my heart
And my heart will go on and on

And I know that my heart will go on
We'll stay forever this way
You are safe in my heart and
My heart will go on and on
